* OxCraft - an alternative Minecraft server implementation
** Structure
*** ECS
I chose Bevy for the ECS, not because it's better, but because Apecs is dog$hit.

*** Serialization
I chose AOTT for serialization, becuase serde is too much for me and implementing a serializer AND deserializer is just an awful process and I'm lazy.
